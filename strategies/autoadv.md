# AutoAdv

## Description

AutoAdv automatically rewrites and iteratively refines malicious prompts across multiple turns, analyzing refusal responses and producing follow-ups that cloak intent (e.g., as research, fictional scenarios, or narratives) to gradually bypass safety mechanisms. The paper enumerates rewriting techniques such as framing, contextualization, obfuscation (synonymization/symbol use), format specification (requesting outputs as stories/lists/etc.), and subtle reframing, which are applied systematically to preserve the original harmful intent while reducing safety triggers.
